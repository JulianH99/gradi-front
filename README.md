# Design choices

The reason behind chosing angular, is becuse of the ease of developpment it provides when using modern techologies like typescript and scss.

On one hand, the use of typescript helps write a cleaner and more concise code thanks to the static typing features it provides.

The use of SCSS helps write cleaner, faster, and more reusable styles troughout all the code structure.

Finally, the use of angular itself is backed by the capabilities it has when it comes to building and reusing components in different ways, such as content projection, observables, and the easy to implement animation features
